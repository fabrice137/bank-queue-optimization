iyo umu client aje kuri site:
- login/register
- home page (iriho: last appoint, info update, find nearby branches, find available services)
-1- picks service (shows nearby branches queue status :: [shows 3/4 branches with long vertical box with 8hours low-medium-high traffic])
-2- picks branch (shows services queue status :: [shows 3/4 services with long vertical box with 8hours low-medium-high traffic])
-3- creates appointment: choose a branch -> pick a service -> appointment callendar [shows table with 10min box indicating low-medium-high traffic]
- clicks on a box then confirms.



# SELECT appointments WHERE district is KIGALI [FOR -1- SERVICE IS KNOWN]
-- list the branches 
-- loop for each branch to list appointments incrementing each hour's variable (in an array maybe)  
-- send json of 3/4 branches with their 8 variables to be color codded due to count (maybe a formula would help)

# SELECT appointments WHERE branch_id is id [FOR -2- BRANCH IS KNOWN]
-- list the services 
-- loop for each service to list appointments incrementing each hour's variable 
-- send json of 3/4 services with their 8 variables to be color codded due to count

# SELECT appointments WHERE branch_id AND service_id [FOR -3- BOTH KNOWN]
-- make 10 minutes matrix callendar as variable
-- loop through appointments updating the matrix callendar boxes
